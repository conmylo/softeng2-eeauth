# Software Engineering II - AUTh, ECE 2023-2024

Welcome to the Software Engineering II Project repository for the academic year 2023-2024 at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## Overview
This repository fulfills the requirements for the Software Engineering II Project, focusing on ***Agile Project*** Management Methodology. The naming convention of branches follows the ***GitFlow Workflow***.

Check this article for [GitFlow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for more details.

The node server is autogenereted using *SwaggerHub*. See details [below](#swagger-generated-server)!

## Swagger generated server

### Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
